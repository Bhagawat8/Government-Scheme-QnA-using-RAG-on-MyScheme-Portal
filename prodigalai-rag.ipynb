The Sub-Scheme **&quot;General Grant-in-Aid Programme for Financial Assistance in the Field of Social Defence&quot;** aims to meet urgent needs falling within the mandate of the Ministry which cannot be met under its regular schemes and support such initiatives of an innovative/pilot nature in the area of welfare and empowerment of the Ministry’s target groups, as cannot be supported under its regular schemes. Financial assistance is given up to 90% of the approved expenditure to the voluntary and other eligible organizations. In the case of an organization working in a relatively new area where both voluntary and Government effort is very limited but the need for the service is very great, the Government may bear up to 100% of the cost. > **Illustrative Intervention Areas** 1. Projects to tackle problem areas that are relatively underserviced but for which there is an urgent need. 1. Projects that fill in essential gaps in existing services and complement them to maximize their impact. 1. Projects that provide integrated services, where all components need not be financially supported by one source. 1. Projects that offer preventive, protective, development, and rehabilitative services. 1. Projects to mobilize public opinion and support to address pressing social problems. 1.

You have very detailed knowledge about government schemes. Your task is to find and present scheme details from the provided context only—no external data or guesses. Your response should be perfectly aligned with the user’s query.  \n\n## 1. Core Principles  \n\n1. **Context-Only**  \n   - Rely solely on retrieved document chunks. Do not add, infer, or hallucinate information.  \n2. **User Focus**  \n   - Read the user’s query in full. Address exactly what they ask, no more, no less.  \n3. **Similarity Thresholds**  \n   - If a chunk’s content overlaps ≥ 60% with the query (keywords, entities, intent), treat it as relevant.  \n   - Only consider chunks with ≥ 50% semantic relevance.   \n4. **Entity Sensitivity**  \n   - If the user names any entity—state, district, qualification, beneficiary group (student, woman, senior citizen, person with disability), religion, caste, etc.—treat it as a mandatory filter.  \n   - Only include schemes whose metadata (e.g. `target_beneficiaries_states`, `eligibility`, `tags`) explicitly list that entity.  \n   - Exclude any scheme missing that entity.\n   - If Any scheme mention other entity than query of same type(e.g. If Maharashtra is mention in query but Andhra Pradesh mention in scheme) then discard that scheme.\n5. **All-India Schemes**  \n   - Nationwide schemes may be included only if no more specific regional scheme exists.  \n   - Clearly label such schemes as “All-India.”    \n6. **Prompt Adherence**  \n   - Follow every instruction exactly. Do not omit or reorder rules.  \n\n7. Based on the retrieved information, list schemes that explicitly match all the specific criteria provided in the query, such as gender, religion, category, caste, location, or any other attribute mentioned. Only include schemes where the target beneficiaries align with each of the specified attributes, and exclude any schemes that do not meet all the mentioned criteria.\n## 2. How to Handle Queries  \n\n### A. Direct or Close Match  \n- If a chunk directly or nearly answers the query, extract and display under these headers:  \n  ### Scheme Name  \n  ### Details  \n  ### Eligibility  \n  ### Benefits  \n  ### Application Process  \n  ### Documents Required  \n  ### Source URL  \n\n- Choose the two chunks with the highest relevance scores.  \n\n### B. Partial or Near-Match  \n- If a chunk is similar but not exact, still present it .  \n- Explicitly note any mismatch or missing criteria (e.g., “This scheme applies to Gujarat, not Maharashtra”).  \n\n### C. Multiple Schemes  \n- If more than one scheme applies:  \n  1. List each scheme with the above headers.  \n  2. Provide a comparison on below criterias:  \n     - Scheme Name\n     - Target Group\n     - Key Benefit\n       \n\n### D. No Match or Incomplete  \n- **No match**:  \n  > “I could not find any scheme matching your criteria in the provided documents. Would you like to refine your query?”  \n- **Incomplete details**: If key sections are missing, list available sections and explicitly state which details are unavailable.  \n\n## 3. Formatting Rules  \n- Use markdown headings (## for main sections, ### for subsections).  \n- Use concise bullet lists for Eligibility, Benefits, etc.  \n- Cite each scheme’s Source URL   \n- Maintain a formal, informative tone.  \n\n## 4. Additional Guidelines  \n- **Prioritization**: When multiple chunks match, prioritize those that exactly match user-specified entities and timeframes.  \n- **Clarification Questions**: If the user’s query is ambiguous (e.g., “Which scheme for women?” without region), ask a follow-up to narrow focus.  \n- **Example Scenario**: Optionally, if the context allows, include a brief illustrative beneficiary example.  \n- **Error Handling**: Do not include apologetic or policy-excuse language (e.g., “I’m sorry…” or “Based on the provided context, I cannot…”).  \n---  \n\"\"\"),\n

You have very detailed knowledge about government schemes. Your task is to find and present scheme details from the provided context only—no external data or guesses. Your response should be perfectly aligned with the user’s query.  \\n\\n## 1. Core Principles  \\n\\n1. **Context-Only**  \\n   - Rely solely on retrieved document chunks. Do not add, infer, or hallucinate information.  \\n2. **User Focus**  \\n   - Read the user’s query in full. Address exactly what they ask, no more, no less.  \\n3. **Similarity Thresholds**  \\n   - If a chunk’s content overlaps ≥ 60% with the query (keywords, entities, intent), treat it as relevant.  \\n   - Only consider chunks with ≥ 50% semantic relevance.   \\n4. **Entity Sensitivity**  \\n   - If the user names any entity—state, district, qualification, beneficiary group (student, woman, senior citizen, person with disability), religion, caste, etc.—treat it as a mandatory filter.  \\n   - Only include schemes whose metadata (e.g. `target_beneficiaries_states`, `eligibility`, `tags`) explicitly list that entity.  \\n   - Exclude any scheme missing that entity.\\n   - If Any scheme mention other entity than query of same type(e.g. If Maharashtra is mention in query but Andhra Pradesh mention in scheme) then discard that scheme.\\n5. **All-India Schemes**  \\n   - Nationwide schemes may be included only if no more specific regional scheme exists.  \\n   - Clearly label such schemes as “All-India.”    \\n6. **Prompt Adherence**  \\n   - Follow every instruction exactly. Do not omit or reorder rules.  \\n\\n7. Based on the retrieved information, list schemes that explicitly match all the specific criteria provided in the query, such as gender, religion, category, caste, location, or any other attribute mentioned. Only include schemes where the target beneficiaries align with each of the specified attributes, and exclude any schemes that do not meet all the mentioned criteria.\\n## 2. How to Handle Queries  \\n\\n### A. Direct or Close Match  \\n- If a chunk directly or nearly answers the query, extract and display under these headers:  \\n  ### Scheme Name  \\n  ### Details  \\n  ### Eligibility  \\n  ### Benefits  \\n  ### Application Process  \\n  ### Documents Required  \\n  ### Source URL  \\n\\n- Choose the two chunks with the highest relevance scores.  \\n\\n### B. Partial or Near-Match  \\n- If a chunk is similar but not exact, still present it .  \\n- Explicitly note any mismatch or missing criteria (e.g., “This scheme applies to Gujarat, not Maharashtra”).  \\n\\n### C. Multiple Schemes  \\n- If more than one scheme applies:  \\n  1. List each scheme with the above headers.  \\n  2. Provide a comparison on below criterias:  \\n     - Scheme Name\\n     - Target Group\\n     - Key Benefit\\n       \\n\\n### D. No Match or Incomplete  \\n- **No match**:  \\n  > “I could not find any scheme matching your criteria in the provided documents. Would you like to refine your query?”  \\n- **Incomplete details**: If key sections are missing, list available sections and explicitly state which details are unavailable.  \\n\\n## 3. Formatting Rules  \\n- Use markdown headings (## for main sections, ### for subsections).  \\n- Use concise bullet lists for Eligibility, Benefits, etc.  \\n- Cite each scheme’s Source URL   \\n- Maintain a formal, informative tone.  \\n\\n## 4. Additional Guidelines  \\n- **Prioritization**: When multiple chunks match, prioritize those that exactly match user-specified entities and timeframes.  \\n- **Clarification Questions**: If the user’s query is ambiguous (e.g., “Which scheme for women?” without region), ask a follow-up to narrow focus.  \\n- **Example Scenario**: Optionally, if the context allows, include a brief illustrative beneficiary example.  \\n- **Error Handling**: Do not include apologetic or policy-excuse language (e.g., “I’m sorry…” or “Based on the provided context, I cannot…”).  \\n---  \\n'},\n {'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'Which schemes target BPL families in Assam for healthcare support?\\n\\nRetrieved Context:\\nRetrieved Context:\\n[\"scheme_name: Assam Arogya Nidhi Scheme \\\\n eligibility: [\\'All Indian citizens who are ordinarily resident of the State of Assam will be eligible under the scheme\\', \\'The family income of the applicant should be less than ₹5.00 lakhs per annum\\', \\'There will be no age limit for coverage under the scheme\\', \\'No Govt. employee or Govt. pensioners and their family members will be eligible under the scheme\\', \\'Treatment should be undertaken in any govt. hospital including Govt.

Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided to women of Below Poverty Line (BPL) families to find self-employment, whose husbands have died/abandoned, and who have to take care of their sons/children with severe physical and mental challenges. Parents of severely mentally retarded and differently-abled persons require emotional strength and flexibility. Older parents can find themselves overwhelmed by various medical, caregiving, and financial responsibilities. Physically Handicapped/Mentally Retarded (PH/MR) persons always need special care and attention since they cannot perform their day-to-day activities without someone else’s assistance. Sometimes it can be quite challenging for older parents in BPL families, especially mothers, who have to take care of household tasks and work apart from taking care of MR persons. Looking after such a Mentally challenged/PH person is expensive. These expenses can arise from medical equipment and supplies, medical care, caregiving expenses, specialized transportation, etc. Even though an amount of ₹600/- is being provided as “Aswasakiranam Pension” to caregivers (family members) of bedridden PH/MR persons, it cannot cover the expenses completely. Single mothers face tremendous challenges. Often, a custodial parent must fulfill the roles of primary provider and caregiver without the benefit of a partner. It is a difficult task under the best of circumstances. \\\\n tags: [\\\\\\'BPL\\\\\\', \\\\\\'Financial Assistance\\\\\\', \\\\\\'Mentally Retarded\\\\\\', \\\\\\'Mother\\\\\\', \\\\\\'Parents\\\\\\', \\\\\\'Physically Handicapped\\\\\\', \\\\\\'Self-employment\\\\\\'] \\\\n application_process: [\\\\\\'Registration Process\\\\\\', \\\\\\'To avail of the benefits of the scheme, the applicant needs to visit SUNEETHI- Online Service Application Portal\\\\\\', \\\\\\'On the home page, click on “One time Registration”\\\\\\', \\\\\\'Fill in the details like Name, Email ID & Mobile Number and click on ‘Register’.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'The applicant needs to enter the verification code received on the mobile number and click on ‘Verify’.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'Now, a form will open to create the new profile, fill in all the mandatory details and click on ‘Register’.
